#### APSILG stands for "APSILG Particle System Interaction Laws Generator" ####

angle laws toggle
speed laws toggle
sometimes A don't react to B at all and B fears to be near A
interaction law type changing (with toggle)
randomize pos and types
randomize colors
randomize rules
randomize all
gui
type ratios when randomizing types setting
bg color setting
bg fade speed setting
change particle number
change type number
save a number of rule sets to allow going back to previous rule sets
save rule set to a file
load rule set from a file
wall settings like barrier, warp, force field
left/right wall settings independant from top/bottom wall settings
gravity setting (towards bottom) and gravity sensibility for each type
friction for each type
find what to do with the radius
fps
vsync/wait setting
fullscreen setting
save the full app state when closing and load it when re-opening (session)
save and load sessions from files
antialiasing setting
allow to change how the generator works
file save and load generator settings (with nice syntax for writing it by hand)
allow the generator to sometimes break all its limits
find and add other cool laws and properties (with settings)
find a good licence (maybe MIT)
put dat fat boi on github
enhance the bonk against the walls ( \_/ -> \/ )
interact with the mouse
add the alpha color component to particle colors (but rand to 1.0 very often)
add the none particle type (0) (full transparent, don't interact)
make type changing smooth (law for each type transition) (int laws are dom type)
make disappearing particles turn type 0 before
speed factor and number of inter per frame settings
part tail and number of vertices setting
make _comp.py add the shader source codes into the binary executable
add a button to produce files that contain the embedded shader source codes
enhance the quality and readability of _comp.py, especially the src insertion
do something with the main parameters
fix the rg floating point exceptions when badly used
